# ATM Simulation in Python

##  Project Description

This is a **console-based ATM simulation project** built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The project simulates basic ATM functionalities such as creating a PIN, checking balance, changing PIN, and withdrawing money through a menu-driven interface.

This project is suitable for **beginners** who want to practice Python, OOP, and basic program flow control.
